Installation
---
The most preferable way to use this library is cocoapods. Add the following line to your `Podfile`:
```sh
pod 'SRAttractionsMap'
```
and run `pod install` in your terminal.

Alternatively, you can manually add the files in the `SRAttractionsMap` directory to your project.

Usage
--
First of all, you need to have an array of attractions(SRAttraction objects) to show:
```swift
let attraction = SRAttraction(latitude: 52.362315, longitude: 4.857548)
```
You can specify different parameters for your attraction:
```swift
attraction.name = title
attraction.subname = subtitle
attraction.image = image
```

After you attractions are ready you should create a custom instance of SRAttractionsMapViewController(subclass of UIViewController):
```swift
let mapVC = SRAttractionsMapViewController(attractions: attractions, displayMode: .allAttractions)
```
or:
```swift
let mapVC = SRAttractionsMapViewController(customPinImage: pinIcon, attractions: attractions, displayMode: .allAttractions)
```
The second convenience initializer allows you to use your custom icon for pins on the map

Display mode decides how the map gonna be zoomed in initially after appearing of the view controller. You have few options:
```swift
/// All attractions will be shown on the map
case allAttractions

/// The first location as the initial point and the radius is the distance to the second attraction times zoomRadiusMultiplier
case firstTwoAttractions

/// The user's location as the initial point and the radius is the distance to the first attraction times zoomRadiusMultiplier
case userAndFirstAttraction

/// The user's location as the initial point and the radius is the distance to the closest attraction times zoomRadiusMultiplier
case userAndTheClosestLocation
```

After that you View Controller is ready and you can present it:
```swift
self.present(mapVC, animated: true, completion: nil)
```
or:
```swift
let nVC = UINavigationController(rootViewController: mapVC)
self.present(nVC, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

If you want to add CTA on your attraction's view, please specify the title for the button:
```swift
mapVC.calloutDetailButtonTitle = "View directions"
```
And the action for every attraction it its object(SRAttraction):
```swift
attraction.detailAction = { _ in
    let mapItem = MKMapItem(placemark: MKPlacemark(coordinate: attraction.coordinate, addressDictionary:nil))
    mapItem.openInMaps(launchOptions: [MKLaunchOptionsDirectionsModeKey : MKLaunchOptionsDirectionsModeWalking])
}
```

You can also customize few more properties:
```swift
/// The multiplier radius of initial zooming for display modes
/// firstTwoAttractions/userAndFirstAttraction/userAndTheClosestLocation
public var zoomRadiusMultiplier: Double = 2
/// If this theshold in the mode .userAndTheClosestLocation exceeds
/// - the map will be switched to the .allAttractions mode
public var closestDistanceThreshold: CLLocationDistance = 10000

/// Animation duration. Set to nil if you don't want to have the animation
public var calloutFadeInAnimationDuration: TimeInterval? = 0.25
/// The size of the callout view which shows when a pin is selected
public var calloutViewSize: CGSize!

/// Font for the title of an attraction
public var calloutTitleFont: UIFont?
/// Text color for the title of an attraction
public var calloutTitleColor: UIColor?

/// Font for the title of an attraction
public var calloutSubtitleFont: UIFont?
/// Text color for the title of an attraction
public var calloutSubtitleColor: UIColor?

/// Font for the text on the CTA button on the callout view
public var calloutDetailButtonFont: UIFont?
/// Text color for the CTA button on the callout view
public var calloutDetailButtonTextColor: UIColor?

/// Moves a selected pin to the center if true
public var shouldScrollToPin = true
/// Custom marker for attractions on the map
public var customPinImage: UIImage?
```
